What is Machine Learning?
->in simple way, we want machine to do something that we want without being repeating knocking means once we program machine for something then it should be learn by itself when it comes to new data.
-> other terms allow computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

AI VS ML VS DL
-> these all 3 are related concepts ,each representing a different level of complexity in creating different intelligent system.

AI-> this one, we can say that it is any technique which enables machine or computer to mimic as human intelligence.

ML->it is subset of ai that focuses on devloping algorithm that allow computer to learn from data and also improve perfomance without being explicitly programmed.

DL(Deep Learning)->Specilized subset of ML that use artificial neural network consist of multiple neural network that can automatically extract and learn features from large amout of data.

Perfomance of ML VS DL \

then you will said why we need DL when we have ML?
becuse DL is useful when data is very very large and extract features(inputs) in ML become hectic and difficult so we need algo that can do by themselves
and also after some constatly data feeding , at some point ML isn't increasing it'e perfomance sso..,
so don't we need ML?
Ans is no, we need it becase everytime we don't have large amount of data ,in daily life problems like medical Diagnostics, Banknote authentication etc.
